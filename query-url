Create directory with alternitave landing pages.
- this.props.location is available at the top level from the react router, it'll need to be passed down to the login component.

This is what the query string will look like:
http://localhost:8080/organisations?beng=yesmate

Logging the props at AppWrapper.js we have access to `location` and within location we have access to `query` and within query the key value pair of the query in the above URL is set. So with the above example it would appear like this:

```
location: {
  query {
    beng: 'yesmate'
  }
}
```

So we need to check within the login component which page we're going to render.
